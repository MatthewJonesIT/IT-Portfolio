# Hikvision DVR Recovery & Remote Access

## Problem
Our new house came with a Hikvision CCTV system that was locked, and access to the DVR was impossible.  
As a result, the cameras could not be monitored either on the local network or remotely via mobile devices.

## Solution
- Connected the DVR to a powerline adapter for network access
- Used Hikvision software to retrieve the encryption code from the DVR
- Submitted the code to Hikvision support and received a new access code
- Logged in to the DVR and configured cameras for local and remote viewing
- Configured cameras to record only on motion detection to optimize storage usage

## Outcome
- Full access restored to the DVR
- Cameras now accessible both locally and remotely

## What I Learned
- Troubleshooting locked networked devices
- Working with vendor security workflows
- Remote access configuration for networked devices
- Practical experience integrating networked devices into an existing home network
