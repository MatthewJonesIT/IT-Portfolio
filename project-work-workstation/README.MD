# Workstation Assembly & Troubleshooting for New Starter

## Problem
Needed to provide a working PC for a new starter, but no fully operational workstations were available.

## Solution
- Diagnosed existing hardware to identify functional components
- Salvaged a working power supply from a PC that powers up but has no display output
- Combined it with a PC that would not power on to create a fully operational workstation
- Verified functionality of the assembled PC before deployment

## Outcome
- Fully functional workstation created from existing hardware
- New starter was able to begin work without delay
- Avoided unnecessary hardware purchases by creatively using existing components

## What I Learnt
- Diagnosing and testing PC hardware components
- Hands-on assembly and troubleshooting
- Resourceful problem-solving in constrained environments
