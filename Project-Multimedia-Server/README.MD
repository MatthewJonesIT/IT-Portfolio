#Multimedia Server Project

This repository documents the end-to-end design and deployment of a self-hosted multimedia server running Plex and Navidrome on Ubuntu Server.

The project covers the full lifecycle:

- Hardware selection and justification
- Ubuntu Server installation and configuration
- Service deployment (Plex & Navidrome)
- Reverse proxy setup and secure remote access
- Storage configuration and backup strategy
- Ongoing maintenance and optimisation

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical Linux administration, networking fundamentals, reverse proxy configuration, and real-world service deployment in a home lab environment.
