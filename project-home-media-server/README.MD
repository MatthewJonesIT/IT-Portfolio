# TerraMaster NAS Setup for Plex Media Server

## Problem
Needed a reliable media server at home to stream content locally and remotely.  
Network performance needed to be optimised for smooth streaming.

## Solution
- Set up a TerraMaster NAS as a Plex media server
- Assigned a static IP to ensure consistent network access
- Connected the NAS directly to the router using Cat6 cable to minimise signal degradation
- Configured NAS storage as JBOD rather than RAID, since no critical data is stored and flexibility for media expansion was preferred
- Configured Plex for both local and remote streaming
- Mapped NAS folders as network drives on Windows for streamlined file management and media organisation

## Outcome
- Plex media server operational and accessible both locally and remotely
- Stable streaming performance with minimal buffering
- NAS configured for future media expansion and streamlined file management

## What I Learned
- Configuring networked storage devices for home use
- Assigning static IPs to improve network reliability
- Optimising device placement to reduce network performance issues
- Deploying and configuring Plex for local and remote access
