# IT Portfolio – Matthew Jones

Welcome to my IT Portfolio! This repository showcases hands-on IT projects I’ve completed while studying CompTIA A+ and Microsoft/Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900 & MS-900). Each project demonstrates practical skills in designing, configuring, and troubleshooting IT systems, with a focus on real-world applications for home and small office environments.
